MERGE SORT: Based on divide and conquer algorithm.

Approach: 1. Base Case: If there is only one or less elements in the array, it means
                        that the array is already sorted. So we can return the array.
          	 2. Recursive Case: 1. Find the middle point of the array.
                             		2. Recursively call mergeSort on the two subarrays divided 
                                	    by the middle point.
                            		3. Merge two smaller sorted subarrays, by making comparisions 
                               		    among the elements of the two subarrays.
