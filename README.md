# Welcome to my Repository "Interview-Prep"!

Hello, My name is Monika Nayak. I am a second-year undergraduate at **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi**. I am pursuing my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. 

There is this famous quote in one of my favorite book "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. "The right time is an illusion, don't wait for it - if you are waiting for the right time to start something. Then it will never come. Start working now because even if you fail, you are learning something new, which will be helpful to you in the future."

I am starting my journey of Interview Preparation by learning Data Structures and Algorithms and I will be sharing all the resources I will be using for practice. Also I will commit all my solutions of Leetcode & GFG questions in this repo.

So, go through the files and I hope this will be helpful to you and to me as well in future. Thank You for passing by ;)
